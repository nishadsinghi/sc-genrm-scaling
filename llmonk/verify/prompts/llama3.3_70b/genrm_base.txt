Example 1:

Question: 
Let  
\\[
f(x) =
\\begin{{cases}}
ax + 3, & \\text{{if }} x > 2, \\\\
x - 5, & \\text{{if }} -2 \\leq x \\leq 2, \\\\
2x - b, & \\text{{if }} x < -2.
\\end{{cases}}
\\]

Find \\(a + b\\) if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).

Solution:
To ensure the continuity of the piecewise function, we need to check the continuity at the boundary points x = 2 and x = -2.

At x = 2, the function changes from f(x) = x - 5 to f(x) = ax + 3. For the function to be continuous, we need to find a value of a such that:
\\[
\\lim_{x \\to 2^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 2^+} f(x) = f(2)
\\]

This gives us:
\\[
\\lim_{x \\to 2^-} (x - 5) = \\lim_{x \\to 2^+} (ax + 3) = f(2)
\\]
\\[
2 - 5 = a(2) + 3
\\]
\\[
-3 = 2a + 3
\\]
\\[
-6 = 2a
\\]
\\[
-3 = a
\\]

At x = -2, the function changes from f(x) = 2x - b to f(x) = x - 5. For the function to be continuous, we need to find a value of b such that:
\\[
\\lim_{x \\to -2^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -2^+} f(x) = f(-2)
\\]

This gives us:
\\[
\\lim_{x \\to -2^-} (2x - b) = \\lim_{x \\to -2^+} (x - 5) = f(-2)
\\]
\\[
2(-2) - b = (-2) - 5
\\]
\\[
-4 - b = -7
\\]
\\[
b = 3
\\]

Now we have the values of a and b, and we can find the sum a + b:
\\[
a + b = -3 + 3 = 0
\\]

Answer: 0

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$ 
I hope it is correct.


Expected Solution:
To ensure that the piecewise function \( f(x) \) is continuous, we need to check the points where the definition of the function changes, which are at \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -2 \).

**Step 1: Ensure continuity at \( x = 2 \)**

For \( x = 2 \):
- From the second case of the piecewise function, when \( -2 \leq x \leq 2 \):
  \[
  f(2) = 2 - 5 = -3.
  \]

- From the first case of the piecewise function, when \( x > 2 \):
  \[
  f(2) = a(2) + 3 = 2a + 3.
  \]

To be continuous at \( x = 2 \), we set the two expressions equal:
\[
2a + 3 = -3.
\]

Solving for \( a \):
\[
2a = -3 - 3,
\]
\[
2a = -6,
\]
\[
a = -3.
\]

**Step 2: Ensure continuity at \( x = -2 \)**

For \( x = -2 \):
- From the second case of the piecewise function, when \( -2 \leq x \leq 2 \):
  \[
  f(-2) = -2 - 5 = -7.
  \]

- From the third case of the piecewise function, when \( x < -2 \):
  \[
  f(-2) = 2(-2) - b = -4 - b.
  \]

To be continuous at \( x = -2 \), we set the two expressions equal:
\[
-4 - b = -7.
\]

Solving for \( b \):
\[
-b = -7 + 4,
\]
\[
-b = -3,
\]
\[
b = 3.
\]

**Step 3: Calculate \( a + b \)**

We found:
\[
a = -3 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 3.
\]

Thus, 
\[
a + b = -3 + 3 = 0.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}.
\]


Teacher Verification:
To verify the solution, let's go through each step:

1. **Continuity at \( x = 2 \)**:
   - The left-hand limit is correctly calculated as \( -3 \) using \( f(x) = x - 5 \).
   - The right-hand limit is correctly set up as \( 2a + 3 \) using \( f(x) = ax + 3 \).
   - The equation \( 2a + 3 = -3 \) is correctly solved to find \( a = -3 \).

2. **Continuity at \( x = -2 \)**:
   - The right-hand limit is correctly calculated as \( -7 \) using \( f(x) = x - 5 \).
   - The left-hand limit is correctly set up as \( -4 - b \) using \( f(x) = 2x - b \).
   - The equation \( -4 - b = -7 \) is correctly solved to find \( b = 3 \).

3. **Calculation of \( a + b \)**:
   - With \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 3 \), the sum \( a + b = -3 + 3 = 0 \) is correctly calculated.

Therefore, the solution is accurate, and the answer is correct.

Example 2:

Question: 
Tim wants to invest some money in a bank which compounds quarterly with an annual interest rate of $7\\%$. To the nearest dollar, how much money should he invest if he wants a total of $\\$60,\\!000$ at the end of $5$ years?

Solution:
Step 1: Understand the problem and the formula for compound interest
The formula for the amount $A$ in an account after $n$ years, with principal $P$, annual interest rate $r$ (in decimal), and compounding $q$ times per year is given by $A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{q}\right)^{qn}$. Here, Tim wants to invest an amount $P$ which will become $60000$ after $5$ years with an annual interest rate of $7\\%$ compounded quarterly. So we have $A = 60000$, $r = 0.07$, $q = 4$, and $n = 5$.

Step 2: Plug the given values into the formula
We plug $A = 60000$, $r = 0.07$, $q = 4$, and $n = 5$ into the formula $A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{q}\right)^{qn}$ to get $60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}$.

Step 3: Solve for P
Solving the equation for $P$, we have $P = \frac{60000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{20}}$.

Step 4: Calculate the value
Let's calculate the value of $P$. $P = \frac{60000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{20}} \approx \frac{60000}{\left(1 + 0.0175\right)^{20}} \approx \frac{60000}{\left(1.0175\right)^{20}} \approx \frac{60000}{1.419067227}$.

Step 5: Compute the final value
Computing the final value, $P \approx \frac{60000}{1.419067227} \approx 42353.91884$.

Step 6: Round the answer to the nearest dollar
Rounding to the nearest dollar, $P \approx 42354$.

The final answer is: 42354

Expected Solution:
Recall the formula $A=P\\left(1+\\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}$, where $A$ is the end balance, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $t$ is the number of years, and $n$ is the number of times the interest is compounded in a year. This formula represents the idea that the interest is compounded every $1/n$ years with the rate of $r/n$.\n\nSubstituting the given information, we have \\[60,\\!000=P\\left(1+\\frac{0.07}{4}\\right)^{4 \\cdot 5}.\\]Solving for $P$ gives  $P=42409.474...$, which rounded to the nearest dollar is $\\boxed{\\$42409}$.

Teacher Verification:
## Step 1: Understand the problem and the formula for compound interest
The problem requires finding the initial investment amount $P$ that will grow to $60000$ after $5$ years with an annual interest rate of $7\\%$ compounded quarterly. The formula for compound interest is given by $A = P\left(1 + \frac{r}{q}\right)^{qn}$, where $A$ is the amount after $n$ years, $P$ is the principal, $r$ is the annual interest rate (in decimal), and $q$ is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.

## Step 2: Verify the values plugged into the formula
The values given are $A = 60000$, $r = 0.07$, $q = 4$, and $n = 5$. These values are correctly plugged into the formula to get $60000 = P\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{4 \cdot 5}$.

## Step 3: Solve for P
Solving the equation for $P$ yields $P = \frac{60000}{\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right)^{20}}$. This step is correct as it simply rearranges the formula to isolate $P$.

## Step 4: Calculate the value of P
Calculating the value inside the parentheses first, we get $\left(1 + \frac{0.07}{4}\right) = \left(1 + 0.0175\right) = 1.0175$. Then, raising $1.0175$ to the power of $20$ gives $\left(1.0175\right)^{20} \approx 1.419067227$. This step is correct.

## Step 5: Compute the final value of P
Dividing $60000$ by $1.419067227$ gives $P \approx 42353.91884$. This calculation is correct.

## Step 6: Round the answer to the nearest dollar
Rounding $42353.91884$ to the nearest dollar gives $P \approx 42354$. This is a correct rounding.

## Step 7: Compare with the expected solution
The expected solution uses the same formula and calculates $P$ as $42409.474...$, which rounds to $42409$. The difference between the calculated $42354$ and the expected $42409$ suggests a minor discrepancy in calculation or rounding.
