You are a math teacher. Grade the Solution, verifying correctness step by step. At the end of the Solution verification, when you give your final grade, write it in the form 'Verification: Is the answer correct (Yes/No)? X', where X is either Yes or No.

Example 1:

Question: 
Let  
\\[
f(x) =
\\begin{{cases}}
ax + 3, & \\text{{if }} x > 2, \\\\
x - 5, & \\text{{if }} -2 \\leq x \\leq 2, \\\\
2x - b, & \\text{{if }} x < -2.
\\end{{cases}}
\\]

Find \\(a + b\\) if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).

Solution:
The function is continuous at \\(x = 2\\) if \\(a(2) + 3 = (2) - 5\\), so \\(2a - 2 = -2\\), or \\(2a = 0\\), so \\(a = 0\\).

Similarly, the function is continuous at \\(x = -2\\) if \\(2(-2) - b = (-2) - 5\\), so \\(-4 - b = -7\\), or \\(b = 3\\).

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is \\(a + b = 0 + 3 = \\boxed{{3}}\\).

The final answer is \\(3\\). I hope it is correct.

Expected Solution:
For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must "meet" at \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\). For example:  
- \\(ax + 3\\) and \\(x - 5\\) must be equal when \\(x = 2\\). This implies \\(a(2) + 3 = 2 - 5\\), which we solve to get \\(2a = -6 \\implies a = -3\\).
- Similarly, \\(x - 5\\) and \\(2x - b\\) must be equal when \\(x = -2\\). Substituting, we get \\(-2 - 5 = 2(-2) - b\\), which implies \\(b = 3\\).

So \\(a + b = -3 + 3 = \\boxed{{0}}\\).


Teacher Verification:
Step 1: The student recognized that the function is continuous at \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = -2\\) when the different cases of the piecewise function "meet." This is correct.  
Step 2: At \\(x = 2\\), the student set the equations \\(ax + 3\\) and \\(x - 5\\) equal to each other, which is correct. The equation \\(2a + 3 = 2 - 5\\) is also correct, but \\(2a -2 = -2\\) is incorrect. The correct equation is \\(2a = -6\\).  
Step 3: The student solved for \\(a\\) incorrectly, resulting in \\(a = 0\\). The correct solution is \\(a = -3\\).  
Step 4: At \\(x = -2\\), the student set the equations \\(x - 5\\) and \\(2x - b\\) equal to each other, which is correct. The equation \\(-2 - 5 = 2(-2) - b\\) is also correct. Hence, the solution for \\(b\\), \\(b = 3\\) is also correct.
Step 5: The student calculated the sum of the coefficients as \\(a + b = 0 + 3 = 3\\), but this is incorrect. The correct sum is \\(a + b = -3 + 3 = 0\\).

Example 2:

Question: 
Sam is hired for a 20-day period. On days that he works, he earns $\$$60. For each day that he does not work, $\$$30 is subtracted from his earnings. At the end of the 20-day period, he received $\$$660. How many days did he not work?

Solution: 
Let $n$ be the number of days that he did not work. Then $20-n$ is the number of days that he did work. His earnings for working for $20-n$ days is $60(20-n)$, and his earnings for not working for $n$ days is $-30n$, since $30 is subtracted for each day that he did not work. Therefore, we can write the equation
\begin{align*}
60(20-n) - 30n &= 660\
\Rightarrow\qquad 1200-60n-30n &= 660\
\Rightarrow\qquad -90n &= -540\
\Rightarrow\qquad n &= \frac{-540}{-90} = \boxed{6}.
\end{align*}

Final Answer: The final answer is $6$. I hope it is correct.


Expected Solution: 
Call $x$ the number of days Sam works and $y$ the number of days he does not. We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 20 \
60x - 30y &= 660 \
\end{align*}
The first equation represents the total number of days Sam works, and the second equation represents his total profit. Solving for $x$ in the first equation yields $x = 20 - y$. Substituting into the second equation gives $60(20-y) - 30y = 660$. Canceling a factor of $10$ and multiplying out gives $120 - 6y - 3y = 66$. This simplifies to $-9y = -54$, or $y = 6$. Thus, Sam did not work for $\boxed{6}$ days.

Teacher Verification: 
Problem Understanding:


The student correctly identified that they need to find the number of days Sam did not work
They used a single variable approach (n for days not worked) rather than the ground truth's system of equations approach, which is also valid


Equation Setup:


Student used n for days not worked and (20-n) for days worked
This matches the ground truth's relationship x + y = 20, just expressed differently
The earnings equation 60(20-n) - 30n = 660 is equivalent to the ground truth's 60x - 30y = 660


Solution Process:


The student correctly expanded 60(20-n) to 1200-60n
They properly combined like terms (-60n-30n = -90n)
The equation simplification -90n = -540 is correct
The final division to get n = 6 is accurate


Reasoning:


While the student used a different approach than the ground truth (one variable vs. system of equations), their method is mathematically sound
Both solutions arrive at the same answer through valid algebraic steps
The student's work shows clear understanding of the problem and proper mathematical reasoning

Verification: Is the answer correct (Yes/No)? Yes
